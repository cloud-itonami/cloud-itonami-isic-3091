# ADR-0001: MotoAdvisor ⊣ Motorcycle Plant Operations Governor architecture

## Status

Accepted. `cloud-itonami-isic-3091` promoted from `:spec` to
`:implemented` in the `kotoba-lang/industry` registry, following the
verified fresh-scaffold protocol established by prior actors in this
fleet.

## Context

`cloud-itonami-isic-3091` publishes an OSS blueprint for motorcycle
**plant operations coordination** (production-batch product-category/
engine-displacement/quantity/weld-defect-rate data logging, welding/
assembly/test-bench-equipment maintenance scheduling, safety-concern
flagging, and outbound shipment coordination). Like every actor in
this fleet, the blueprint alone is not an implementation: this ADR
records the governed-actor architecture that promotes it to real,
tested code, following the same langgraph StateGraph + independent
Governor + Phase 0->3 rollout pattern established across the
cloud-itonami fleet.

The closest domain analog is `cloud-itonami-isic-3092` (Manufacture of
bicycles and invalid carriages): both are back-office coordination
actors for a fixed frame-welding/assembly/test-bench-inspection plant
with a real physical safety dimension, and both share the same
four-op shape (`:log-production-batch`/`:schedule-maintenance`/
`:flag-safety-concern`/`:coordinate-shipment`) and the same
two-entity verified/registered gate structure (equipment for
maintenance scheduling, batch for shipment coordination). Also
closely related is `cloud-itonami-isic-2211` (Manufacture of rubber
tyres and tubes), the earlier fixed-processing-plant template both
3092 and this build descend from. This build mirrors
`cloud-itonami-isic-3092`'s architecture closely but adapts the
hazard profile and equipment/product vocabulary to the motorcycle
plant: this vertical's production-batch record declares a
`:product-category` (closed set spanning standard/sport/cruiser/
touring/adventure/naked/off-road motorcycles plus scooters, mopeds
and electric motorcycles) and an `:engine-displacement-cc` (a
physically plausible rated engine displacement, plausibility-checked
0-3000, where 0 legitimately covers electric motorcycles) in addition
to a `:weld-defect-rate-percent`, rather than 3092's
`:weight-capacity-kg`; its equipment vocabulary spans frame-welding
robots, engine-assembly lines, final-assembly lines and emissions-
dyno test benches rather than 3092's frame-welding/assembly/
structural-test-bench units; and its shipment quantity is tracked in
finished-product UNITS (`:units`/`:quantity-units`/`:shipped-units`),
the same counted-not-weighed shape as 3092's finished bicycles.

This vertical additionally has a DIFFERENT type-approval/
certification regime than 3092's ISO 4210/ISO 7176: manufacture of
motorcycles is subject to ECE R78 (motorcycle brake-system
type-approval) and ECE R40 (motorcycle emissions type-approval)
regimes (UNECE WP.29). This actor is never the type-approval
authority — any proposal (regardless of op) that declares
`:issue-certification? true` is a HARD, PERMANENT, unconditional
block (`motomfg.governor/certification-authority-blocked-
violations`), the same "no phase, no human override" posture as the
equipment-actuation block.

This vertical has NO pre-existing `kotoba-lang/motomfg`-style
capability library to wrap (verified: no such repo exists). This build
therefore uses self-contained domain logic — pure functions in
`motomfg.registry` (equipment/batch verification, shipment-quantity
recompute, product-category validation, engine-displacement
plausibility validation, weld-defect-rate plausibility validation) are
re-verified independently by the governor, the same "ground truth,
not self-report" discipline established across prior actors (most
directly `cloud-itonami-isic-3092`'s `bikemfg.registry` and
`cloud-itonami-isic-2211`'s `tyremfg.registry`).

This blueprint's own `:itonami.blueprint/governor` keyword,
`:motorcycle-plant-operations-governor`, is grep-verified UNIQUE
fleet-wide (`gh search code "motorcycle-plant-operations-governor"
--owner cloud-itonami`, zero hits before this repo was created).

## Decision

### Decision 1: Self-contained domain logic (no external motorcycle-manufacturing capability library to wrap)

Unlike actors that delegate to pre-existing domain libraries, this
motorcycle vertical has NO pre-existing capability library to wrap.
The equipment/batch-verification / shipment-quantity /
product-category / engine-displacement / weld-defect-rate validation
functions live as pure functions in `motomfg.registry` and are
re-verified independently by `motomfg.governor` — the same "ground
truth, not self-report" discipline established across prior actors
(most directly `cloud-itonami-isic-3092`'s `bikemfg.registry`).

### Decision 2: Coordination, not control — scope boundary at the back-office

This actor is **strictly back-office coordination** of motorcycle
plant operations. It does NOT:
- Control welding, assembly, or test-bench equipment directly
- Make plant-safety or type-approval decisions (exclusive to the human plant supervisor / accredited type-approval body)
- Actuate welding/assembly/test-bench equipment
- Self-issue an ECE R78/ECE R40 motorcycle type-approval certification mark

All proposals are `:effect :propose` only. The advisor proposes; the
governor validates; escalation paths funnel to human plant-supervisor
approval. This is not a replacement for the supervisor's authority or
the type-approval body's authority — it is a proposal-screening and
documentation layer.

**CRITICAL SAFETY BOUNDARY**: motorcycle manufacturing is a
safety-critical domain (structural-integrity/brake-safety hazard,
emissions-compliance hazard, ECE R78/R40 type-approval certification,
direct rider/road-user-safety consequence). Safety-concern flagging
NEVER auto-commits. All safety concerns escalate immediately to human
review.

### Decision 3: Safety-concern escalation — always human sign-off

`:flag-safety-concern` (frame-weld-defect concern, brake-safety
concern, emissions-compliance concern) ALWAYS escalates, never
auto-commits. This is not a "low-stakes proposal" — it is a
circuit-breaker that must reach human authority.

### Decision 4: Two independent verified/registered gates (equipment AND batch), not one

Like `cloud-itonami-isic-3092` and `cloud-itonami-isic-2211`, this
vertical has TWO entity kinds each gating a different op:
`:schedule-maintenance` independently verifies the referenced
**equipment** unit's own `:verified?`/`:registered?` fields;
`:coordinate-shipment` independently verifies the referenced
**batch**'s own `:verified?`/`:registered?` fields. Both are the same
"plant/batch record must be independently verified/registered before
any action" HARD invariant applied to the two distinct record kinds
this domain actually has. `:coordinate-shipment` additionally
independently recomputes whether a batch's own recorded shipped-to-
date unit quantity plus the proposal's own claimed unit quantity would
exceed the batch's own recorded production quantity — never taken on
the advisor's self-report.

### Decision 5: HARD invariants (no override)

Four HARD governor invariants (elaborated into twelve concrete checks
in `motomfg.governor`, mirroring `cloud-itonami-isic-3092`'s own
elaboration of its HARD invariants into concrete checks) block
proposals and cannot be overridden by human approval:
1. Plant/batch record (equipment for maintenance, batch for shipment) must be independently verified/registered before any action is taken against it, and a shipment's quantity must independently recompute within the batch's own logged production quantity
2. Proposals must be `:effect :propose` only (never direct equipment control)
3. Direct welding/assembly/test-bench-equipment control, equipment actuation, or self-issued ECE R78/ECE R40 type-approval certification is permanently blocked
4. The op allowlist is closed — `:log-production-batch`/`:schedule-maintenance`/`:flag-safety-concern`/`:coordinate-shipment` only

## Consequences

(+) Motorcycle plant operations back-office now has a documented,
governed, auditable coordination layer that funnels all decisions
through independent validation before human approval.

(+) The "coordination, not control" boundary is explicit in code: all
`:effect :propose`, all real-world actuation requires human plant-
supervisor sign-off, and no type-approval certification mark can ever
be self-issued.

(+) Scope is bounded and verifiable: four HARD invariants (elaborated
into twelve concrete governor checks) protect against scope creep into
unauthorized equipment operation, equipment actuation, or
certification self-issuance. Safety concerns are a circuit-breaker,
not a threshold.

(+) Safety-critical discipline is explicit: safety-concern flagging
cannot be rate-limited, suppressed, or auto-decided by phase gate.
Human review is mandatory.

(-) Still a simulation/proposal layer, not a real plant-operations
control system. Equipment actuation, plant operation, and
type-approval issuance remain human-/institution-controlled via
external channels.

(-) No integration with real plant-management databases (equipment
telemetry, batch tracking, freight dispatch, type-approval-body APIs)
— this is a standalone coordinator blueprint.

## Verification

- `cloud-itonami-isic-3091`: `clojure -M:test` green (all tests pass;
  see the superproject ADR and `kotoba-lang/industry` registry entry
  for the exact `Ran N tests containing M assertions, 0 failures, 0
  errors` output, verified from an independent fresh clone), demo
  narrative (`clojure -M:dev:run`) exercises proposal submission,
  escalation, and every HARD-hold scenario directly (not-propose-
  effect, unknown-op, equipment-not-verified, batch-not-verified,
  shipment-quantity-exceeded, equipment-actuate-blocked,
  certification-authority-blocked, already-scheduled, invalid-
  product-category, invalid-engine-displacement, invalid-defect-rate).
- All source is `.cljc` (portable ClojureScript / JVM / nbb) — no
  JVM-only interop; the actor graph is invoked exclusively via
  `langgraph.graph/run*` (not `.invoke`, which is not cljs-portable).
- Audit ledger is append-only, all decisions are traced; every settled
  request (commit or hold) leaves exactly one ledger fact.
- `deps.edn` pins `io.github.kotoba-lang/langgraph` and
  `io.github.kotoba-lang/langchain` via `:local/root` directly in the
  top-level `:deps` (not only under a `:dev` alias), so a bare
  `clojure -M:test` resolves offline inside the monorepo checkout.
